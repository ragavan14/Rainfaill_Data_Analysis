# Rainfall_Data_Analysis

In the project we have analysis on rainfall data. To begin with, the world has faced a lot of water
problems that are an effect of different rainfall patterns. We can understand the need for water and what
made it necessary for us to choose this topic for our major project. The project also gives an
introduction saying what are the existing difficulties related to rainfall(water management) which
makes the rainfall analysis necessary. We discuss what are the traditional methods that have been used
for ages and how rainfall analysis can be of help in order to understand the rainfall pattern.We can
observe the disadvantages of the traditional methods used for rainfall analysis and how computer-based
calculating methods are better and more useful. Then explain what is the problem statement and what is
our view about dealing with it.

A description on technology stack where we will discuss the various technologies used in building the
project and emphasizes the importance of every particular technology giving a brief about the same. A
review of literature to know all the previous works on the similar or the same topic. What are the
outcomes, what are the key derivatives, what are the disadvantages, what can be improvised etc. We
have discussed the implementation to observe how we went about doing every particular step in the
project having detailed description of all the procedures in the project. Finally conclude by analyzing
the obtained graphs.
